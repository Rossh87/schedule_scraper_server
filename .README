##Schedule scraper server

This server receives scraped webpage data, sent by a Chrome extension in JSON format.  
Ultimately it will send a Google Calendar invite to an email recipient that contains
my work schedule for a specified date range.  It is deployed with Google App Engine (Ubuntu-based cloud server).
